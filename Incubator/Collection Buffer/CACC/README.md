# CACC

This project is used for research on intelligent vehicle control via [CACC (Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Adaptive_Cruise_Control). It's a starting project  on [Control and Network Lab (CAN)] (http://eeweblinux.poly.edu/~canlab/). Briefly speaking, we will simluate, model, program and research vehicle behaviors through ___Paramics___ (vehicle and network simulation software). 

But this project is private. So I won't put any src codes related to the key algorithms. However, this repo is initialized for two purposes, __keeping track__ of the project (i.e. I will write project reports) & saving sample __demo codes__.
