# Standarization

1. Project Creation
   + Requirement Analysis and Definition
     + from User Perspectives (functionalities)
     + from Business Perspectives (functionalities)
     + from System Perspectives (contraints)
       + Performances
       + Scalability
       + Stress Resilience
         + Availability 
       + Simplicity
       
2. Project Management
   + Make the architecture ('skeleton' or 'a proof of concept') of the prototype
     + Make Decisions (principles)
       + "For each decision I made, there has to be at least one alternative that I considered and rejected"
       + "Each decision must be traceable to the person who made it"
       + "keep the number of documented decisions somewhere between four and twelve"
       + "be honest"
       + "What assumptions do you make"
       + "just make an assumption and call it a day when the time is limited"
     + Make Decisions (details)
       + tech spec
         + UI
         + backend
           + storage
         + test
         + monitor
         + performance
         
   + Divide tasks into the __manageable__ subtasks
   + Realize Task Dependencies
   + Prioritize tasks
   
3. Communication
4. Implementation
   + Deliver each Task into a __working__ piece of software as fast as possible
   + Spend as few money as possible
